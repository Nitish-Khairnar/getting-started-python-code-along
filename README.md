### Project Overview

 We have IPL Data set which all the match details starting from venue, teams, city, scorecard and every details


### Learnings from the project

 I leant how to access the values and elements in nested dictionaries and list.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I used a step by step approach of taking a look at data in particular dictionary and list


### Challenges faced

 The data was not very easily readable. So I used the yaml format to make it look readable to me.


### Additional pointers

 Dont get scared looking at the huge data, just go accessing step by step data types and we can go inside to answer our questions.
Just a have proper look at our data and understand what exactly its data type is, in order to access their elements.
